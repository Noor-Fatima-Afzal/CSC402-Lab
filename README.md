# CSC402: Computer Graphics - Lab Repository (PyOpenGL)

Welcome to the **CSC402: Computer Graphics** Lab Repository!  
This repository contains all lab exercises and Python source code developed using **PyOpenGL** throughout the semester.

---

## Course Overview

This course explores the principles and programming of **computer graphics** using **Python** and **OpenGL**.  
You‚Äôll learn to create 2D and 3D scenes, apply transformations, implement lighting and textures, and develop interactive graphics applications.

---

Each Lab‚Äôs folder contains:
- Python source files (`.py`)
- Shader files (`.vert`, `.frag`, etc.)
- README or Lab Notes
- Screenshots / Output images (if applicable)
---
## Setup Instructions

### Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.  
Install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate pygame numpy pillow
